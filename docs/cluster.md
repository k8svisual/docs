This is a high-level 3D view of the cluster.  The view is interactive and can be rotated, tilted, zoomed in or out, and filtered.  

The left-hand side of the screen has a slide out that enables filtering the 3D view, control sound, and save the current filter settings as the default.

The right-hand side of the screen has a slide out that provides __Properties__ for any item in the 3D view that is clicked/selected.  Once an item is selected the item will have a red circle plane shown to identify the selected item.

If a Pod is selected the Properties slide out will have a __View pod schematic__ button.  If pressed a __new__ child browser window is opened with the associated pod schematic.

The __Legend__ button provides information related to the displayed icons and planes.
