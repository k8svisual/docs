### Config

From the home screen click the gear in the upper right portion of the screen to open the VpK configuration.   

Multiple items can be configured along with viewing Usage information.  Items that are configurable are:

- managedFields - this controls the displaying of __managedFields__ when a K8s resource information is displayed.  Enabling this 
option will show the managedFields.

- status - controls the displaying of the __status__ section when a K8s resource information is displayed.  Enabling this 
option will show the status information.

- Redact K8s Secret data - controls if the data section of a K8s Secret resource should be redacted. If enabled all items in the 
data section will be replaced with __Content has been REDACTED__.  

!!! Warning

    If this option is modified a complete reload of the selected Snapshot must be performed. The redacting or showing of the data 
    is performed when the Snapshot is processed.

- Snapshot reload - controls if a full reload and re-parse of a Snapshot is performed.  If a selected Snapshot has been processed
and is selected to be processed a second time without loading another Snapshot the default is to perform a soft load of the Snapshot 
data.  Enabling this option will force a complete reload of the selected Snapshot.   

- View usage information - technical information regarding the server and browser are displayed.  See the Usage screen show below.
