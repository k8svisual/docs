Storage provides a view of the defined StorageClasses, Persistent Volumes, and Persistent Volume Claims along with the amount of space requested for each.  

At the top of the view is a legend that shows several color bars that represent the associated storage measurement
of space, e.g KB, MD, GB, TB.

In the scrollable section of the view click on any of the resource icons to view the definition.
