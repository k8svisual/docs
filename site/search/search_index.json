The server component is a node.js application that can communicate with a running instance of a Kubernetes cluster using the kubectl CLI.  The use of other CLI tools other than kubectl is supported.  </p> <p>VpK requires what is called a 'snapshot'.  This is a collection of files that contain information obtained from a running Kubernetes cluster. For VpK to obtain the K8s resource information an existing kubectl CLI connection must be established with the target Kubernetes cluster from where data will be retrieved. </p> <p>The kubectl CLI connection must be established by the user outside of VpK. If no kubectl CLI connection has been established, then no K8s resource data will be retrieved. A series of 'kubectl get' commands are issued to obtain the cluster data.</p> <p>The output from the kubectl CLI is processed to create files that are collectively called a snapshot.  This snapshot is saved in a directory and can be reused without connecting to the K8s cluster for future sessions.  </p> <p>Once a snapshot has been created VpK no longer requires any communication with the Kubernetes cluster. </p> <p>Note</p> <p>VpK is designed as read-only and will not modify a Kubernetes cluster and is not a real-time monitoring tool.  </p>"},{"location":"#vpk-overview-diagram","title":"VpK overview diagram","text":"<p>The following diagram shows the major components and the interactions and storage of the snapshot files.
