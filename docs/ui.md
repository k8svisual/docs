The User Interface (UI), browser component is comprised of a top section and a series of tabs. The tabs provide graphical views of the cluster; deployed workloads; graphs (hierarchy, collapible hierarchy, and circle pack); storage requests with sizes and hierarchy; security; search; and owner references hierarchy.

### Screen Interactions

Interaction with the user interface provides the ability to drill down to obtain additional information.  These interactions include:

- From the 3D Cluster view click on any of the items in the view.
- If you see an icon, click on it. 
- If you see a blue or red circle in a hierarchy diagram, click on it.
- If you see a blue circle in a circle pack diagram, click on it.
- From the Security and OwnerRef Links click on any color shaped object.
