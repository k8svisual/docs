!!! Question 

    It's a new year, what changes do I need to make and keep the plan up to date?  

??? Answer

    - When this software is opened on the computer in the new year the Retirement planning year on the Individuals tab will automatically update to the current year.

    - Review and update the information for the budget, income, and assets.  The updated balances will be used as the starting balances to begin planning.   

    - If either Social Security COLA percentage or Consumer Price Index percentage values are available open the appropriate report from the Useful Info tab, click the lock to allow updating of the tab, and enter the new percentages.
    
    - If either Federal, State, County, or City income tax rates have changed from the Individuals tab click on the pencil to open Detail Tax Data.  Once opened to the TaxRates tab update the appropriate tables as needed.

!!! Question 

    When the plan is generating the message that all calculations have stopped is shown, what should I do?  

??? Answer

    - Review the Retire tab and locate the last year where there is a dollar amount in the column titled __Annual withdrawal from Investment__.  First, don't ignore the message and hope for the best.  If this year is far enough in the future and you don't expect to live past this year all is fine.  If this year is not far enough in the future, you will need to explore how to either increase income or reduce expenses. 

    Income: 

    - If you have a home and can possibly sell it explore what might be a good year for the sale to generate additional income.  The sale of the home is entered in the Housing tab which can be accessed from the Assets tab.

    - Discuss with a financial planner or research if you can get a better rate of return on investments. 

    Expenses:

    - Review any expenses that are classified as Optional and determine if they can be reduced or deleted.
