OwnerRef Links provides a view of the owner reference chain for resources in the selected namespace.  

From the namespace drop-down select a single namespace.  Once a namespace has been selected press the "__View selected namespace__" button. 

If there is no selected namespace a warning message is displayed. 

The results are a graph of the relationships with the Owner at the highest level in the graph.  Click on any of the displayed color rectangles and the associated resource definition will be displayed.
