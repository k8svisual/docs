### Control Point

The Budget tab is the primary tab to enter expenses. Though more than one tab is used to enter expenses and taxes. Consider the following:

| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Budget | Expenses are occurring now. | Enter in the Budget tab using the standard input fields. Ensure the expense amount and annual frequency are correct. |

#### RMD related expenses

During the plan generation the Required Minimum Distribution (RMD) withdrawal amount may not be met requiring an adjustment of additional funds needing to be withdrawn from Before tax investments.  Taxes for this adjustment amount will be subtracted from the total adjustment amount and the net difference added to the After-tax balance for future use.

!!! caution "Avoid the 50% penalty"

    An RMD is the annual Required Minimum Distribution that you must start taking out of your retirement account after you reach age 70 or 72. If you are born after July 1, 1949 the trigger date moves from 70 to 72.  The RMD amount is determined by the fair market value of an individuals before tax funds at the end of the previous year, factored by your age and life expectancy.  The IRS penalty for not taking an RMD, or for taking less than the required amount, is steep: 50% of the amount not taken on time. The deadline to take your first RMD is normally April 1 of the year after you turn 72, and December 31 each following year.
